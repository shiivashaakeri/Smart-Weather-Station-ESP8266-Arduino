# Smart Weather Station
In this project, we’ll implement an IoT system that is normally in Deep Sleep mode. It’ll
wake up every one minute to get the sensor data and publish it on out server using MQTT and
Node-Red. It will be awakened also by a pushbutton which restarts the ESP8266 development
board.
## Components
-  ESP8266 Development Board
-  Temperature and Humidity Sensor (SHT20)
-  Graphic Display Module (NOKIA-5110 Graphic LCD)
-  Breadboard and Wires
-  Battery (or a power bank)
-  Pushbutton
